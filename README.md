# 🌐 Lab: Fetch Data using `useFetch`

This project is an implementation of the **Coursera lab from cognitiveclass.ai**.  
It demonstrates how to fetch data in React using a **custom hook (`useFetch`)** and a corresponding component (`FetchData`).  
By encapsulating data-fetching logic into reusable hooks, the project improves code **maintainability** and **reusability**.

## 🚀 What you will learn
In this lab, you will learn how to:
- Use the **fetch API** in a React app to retrieve external data.  
- Implement a **custom hook (`useFetch`)** to encapsulate fetching logic.  
- Manage **state** and **side effects** using `useState` and `useEffect`.  
- Dynamically render fetched data with **JSX** for interactive UI components.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:  
- ✅ Fetch data from an external API using the `fetch` method inside React.  
- ✅ Build a custom React hook (`useFetch`) for reusing data-fetching logic.  
- ✅ Render fetched data in the UI and display details such as **name, importance, benefits, and best time to intake**.

## 📚 Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of **HTML**  
- Intermediate knowledge of **JavaScript**  
- Basic understanding of **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) and **custom hooks**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** (functional components + hooks)  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **HTML / CSS**  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This lab gives hands-on practice in creating **custom hooks** for data fetching in React, reinforcing concepts of state management and side effects, while building dynamic and maintainable user interfaces.
